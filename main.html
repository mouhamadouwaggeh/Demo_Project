<h2 id="firsth2">ABOUT ME</h2>
<p id="About-Me">My husband Jeff and I have always loved animals. We grew up having a variety of pets and love them like family! We taught our three children to love and respect all living creatures and they are all animal lovers too.We have two dogs, Finn and Chance, and two cats, Sebastian and Star. I opened Fur Friends Family Care in 2012 after our beloved Bulldog passed away. Oliver did not like other dogs, so I had never before entertained the idea of opening my own petsitting business. However, after he passed away and we adopted dogs that didnâ€™t share his aversion to other dogs, my eldest daughter suggested that I try my hand at petsitting because of my love of animals and expertise at caring for them, and I decided to embark on this new adventure. Nearly a decade later, my business has grown quite a bit and we have had the pleasure of caring for dogs from all over the state.My husband, son, and I work as a team. We walk the dogs, play with them, and feed them according to their individual diets. We have also cared for dogs that require a variety of medications. There is always someone home to care for the dogs and keep them company. We have a large, fenced backyard and a dog door that leads out to our covered deck which includes a fan that helps to keep temperatures down in the hot summer months. We do not crate and the dogs enjoy a lot of freedom to roam around the backyard and main floor of our home. We are accepting new clients (both daycare and overnight) and look forward to meeting you and your furry family member!</p>
